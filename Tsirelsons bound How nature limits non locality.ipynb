    "# Tsirelson's bound: How Nature limits non-locality\n",
    "\"Spooky action at a distance\", or more formally non-locality, is one of the (or maybe even the) most intriguing and defining aspects of quantum physics. The idea that our world could be non-local is almost a century old. It started around 1935 when Einstein posed his EPR paradox. Today, science is still exploring the consequences and limitations of this non-locality. This post uses a toy model to understand why our world is non-local. We will also discover that Nature poses a limit to non-locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a definition of non-locality, we follow Valerio Scarani [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Non-locality**: There exist in nature channels connecting two (or more) distant partners that can distribute correlations that can neither be caused by the exchange of a signal (the channel does not allow signaling, and moreover, a hypothetical signal should travel faster than light) nor be due to pre-determined agreement (because the correlations violate the so-called\" Bell's inequalities\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, in our daily lives, we do not experience any non-locality. So, quantum mechanics is more non-local than classical theories. The only known\" channel\" that distributes non-local correlations are\" entangled quantum particles\" [1]. Still, the non-locality in quantum mechanics is not unlimited. Tsirelson proved in 1980 in his famous paper that non-locality in quantum mechanics is limited. Quantum effects can be non-local but cannot be \"too non-local.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Alain Aspect experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "As a metric for non-locality we use the CHSH correlation [2] (for an introduction of CHSH, see our earlier post). The experiment we have in mind is the Alain Aspect experiment, where one pair of entangled photons is distributed to two observers (who are at different locations). These observers can choose to perform a measurement T or a measurement S on their photons. The outcomes of these measurements are either 1 or -1, and for the individual observer, the results will appear totally random. Suppose the correlation between their results violates the Bell inequalities. In that case, we must conclude that we are observing non-local effects (unless the experimenters performing the measurements would be exchanging information. In that case, the exchanged information could cause the correlation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH inequality is formulated as \n",
    "\n",
    "2√2 ≤ CHSH ≤ 2√2\n",
    "\n",
    "CHSH = \\<SS\\> + \\<ST\\> + \\<TS\\> - \\<TT\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here \\<ST\\> denotes the expectation value for a measurement S by the first observer and a measurement T by the second observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Alain Aspect experiment, the T and S measurements correspond to measuring at different polarization orientations. The maximum violation of Bell's inequalities occurs when the angle between measurement T and S for each photon is 45 degrees [3]. The relative polarization angle between the two photons is always 22.5 degrees, except in the case that for both photons the T measurement is used. In that case the relative polarization angle should be 67.5 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, with limited math, we will show in some depth how we can use the formalism of quantum mechanics to calculate the value of the CHSH correlation (which, for specific settings violates Bell's inequalities). We will take the angle of the polarization direction as\n",
    "\n",
    "* First photon.  S: polarization at π/4, T: polarization at 0\n",
    "* Second photon. S: polarization at θ, T: polarization at θ + π/4\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to find that the violation of Bell's inequalities is at its maximum for θ equal to π/8, as this was the setting used by Alain Aspect in his experiments [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "After deriving this result, looking at the maximum violation of Bell's inequality for entangled photons is a small step. This leads to Tsirelson's bound, which poses a limit to the non-locality in quantum mechanics [4]. Tsirelson's bound has triggered a wide range of research on the foundations of quantum mechanics in the past decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is, to a large extent, a mathematical formalism. When explaining quantum concepts without math, we must 'invent' words to describe these concepts. These words can sometimes obtain a meaning beyond their mathematical origin. This post explains quantum mechanical concepts with limited math (a basic high-school-level understanding of sine and cosine functions should be enough). The calculations below are incomplete, and more would need to be done for a 'proof' of any statement. Still, the ambition is to bring the reader a little bit closer to what makes quantum mechanics quantum mechanics.\n",

    "In quantum mechanics, we describe a system's state by the wavefunction and represent physically observable quantities by an 'operator.'

This sounds abstract, so let's make it tangible with photon polarization.\n",

A diagonally polarized photon would be equally likely to end up in either detector.\n",

We could compare horizontal polarization to heads up and vertical polarization to tails up. We cannot stretch this analogy to diagonally polarized light.

    "\n",
    "We can describe this measurement with a 2x2 matrix, indicating which polarizations go to either detector. This matrix represents the observable in quantum mechanics. For this post, we use the convention that if we split between horizontal and vertical polarization, we call it the H measurement. In contrast, if we split between diagonal and anti-diagonal polarization, we call it the D measurement. For the H observable, a horizontally polarized photon should give a '1' as a result, and a vertically polarized photon should give a -1. Similarly, we find a 1 or -1 for (anti-)diagonally polarized light with the D observable.

The polarization of the individual photons is not defined. Only the global state of the two photons combined is specified.

An obvious question is whether this value of 2√2 is the maximum violation of Bell's inequalities we can find or whether there would be an experiment leading to higher values.

Then CHSH² cannot exceed 4, so the CHSH correlation itself has to fall in boundaries set by Bell's inequalities. Even with an entangled state, the individual photons' local measurements must fulfill this criterion. Non-commutating observables are a characteristic of quantum mechanics, and in the classical limit, these commutators would be zero. This means that irrespective of any statement on entanglement, we already concluded that a classical theory cannot violate Bell's inequalities from the properties of these observables.\n",

    "* Each observable for photon detection has an expectation value that will not exceed 1. The observables correspond to detecting a photon behind a polarizer, and the probability of detecting this photon will not exceed 100%. For this reason, it is reasonable that the maximum value for the commutator [H,D] = HD - DH would be 2. To reach this value, we would need perfect anti-commutations (HD = - DH) and  the expectation value for HD to be equal to 1. If we take for the commutators in the above equation this maximum HD. Tsirelson has shown that this upper limit is valid for all of quantum mechanics and that the CHSH correlation within quantum mechanics cannot exceed √8 (=2√2) [4]. So, already in our toy model of two entangled photons, we achieve the highest possible value for the CHSH correlation and the maximum violation of the Bell inequalities.\n",

    "With the CHSH correlation, we can identify different levels of non-locality. If the CHSH value is not higher than 2, we know we can explain the effect by a \"local\" theory. We do not violate Bell's inequalities and can assume that 'local hidden variables' carry all the information needed to generate the correlation. If the CHSH value is not above the Tsirelson limit (so not higher than 2√2), we know we can explain the effect by an entangled quantum system (as we observe in the experiment by Alain Aspect). If we ever observe correlations between 2√2 and the algebraic maximum value of 4 for the CHSH correlation, we know quantum mechanics cannot explain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insight that correlation values above the Tsirelson bound are conceivable but beyond quantum mechanics has triggered new research. Why would Nature limit non-locality? Would this level of non-locality violate the theory of relativity? Are there arguments in information theory to explain this limit? In upcoming posts, we will address this research. For now, we conclude that there is space beyond quantum mechanics! Please leave your comments and builds.\n",
